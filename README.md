# Dwelt: Iron Solstice


**Cleanse and rebuild at the end of the world in _Dwelt: Iron Solstice_, a cleaning and decorating game set amongst a band of robots preparing an overgrown earth for the eventual return of humanity.**
 
##Premise and Precedents

Dwelt is largely built on the foundations of _Jade Spring_, but aims to provide more polished and diverse gameplay, as well as being an original piece of art which builds on previous game attempts like Scruffy, Dwelt (the old version), and Soul-Scrap. As a player you are put into a world which has been torn apart by some calamity – perhaps a vicious, short-lived, magically-driven world war – and which now rests as innumerable fractured islands.

You are a small brass robot ("Armature"), one of many who were left behind by humanity when they fled the broken planet. You (and those around you) woke from an EMP-induced stasis to find the scars of devastation overgrown with greenery and flora, stretching over molten crevasses and crushed steel girders like scabs patching and healing the land. The Armatures, advanced as they all are, can keenly feel their own grief at the flight of their human overseers and kin both. Yet there is more: the pain and anguish of the earth itself, radiating from its counterparts, as it seeks to comprehend and remedy its loss.

It is within this situation that the Armatures determine to participate in the recovery of the world, emboldened by the hope that humanity will return and permanently resettle in a world which has been calmed and reconstructed. And this is _Dwelt's_ key objective: to clear and settle the blights and persevering wounds which prevent stable settlement; and to construct and decorate housing for certain figures and groups that the Armatures are expecting to return.

## Why are there two versions of Dwelt?

You might have seen that there are two versions of _Dwelt_ here on GitHub: _Dwelt: Iron Solstice_ (`dwelt-solstice`) and just _Dwelt_ (`dwelt`). This is basically because I can't at all make up my mind on what I want the game to become! Both games deal with concepts of loss, grief, and remembrance, but in different ways and settings. _Solstice_ is about building and rehabilitating a post-apocalyptic earth, expecting the eventual return of humanity. _Dwelt_ focuses more heavily on death, and is centered around exploration and puzzle solving, _Myst_-style.

In the past I've really struggled with not just deleting all the work that I've stopped vibing with (or feel is just plain bad). For that reason I'm making and maintaining two repos, and allowing myself to switch between them as I feel. I'm hoping that, in having the option of switching any time, actually committing to one might paradoxically be easier (because I no longer feel "trapped" in any creative commitment I make). But enough about me! Thank you for reading.
